Component Category Documentation
--------- -------- -------------

This folder contains two types of component category documentation.

The file CC_Spec.rtf is the Component Category Specification.

The remainder of the material consists of the ActiveX MVB References
(the ActiveX SDK documentation), which contains the official component
category specification.  The program Setup.exe will install this
documentation on your computer.


ActiveX MVB References

This is the complete set of ActiveX references, including the ActiveX 
COM references, in .MVB format. The download includes both Intel and 
RISC versions of InfoViewer to view these files; the correct version 
is installed by default. The .MVB also allows string searching and 
printing of "books". 

Instructions: 

Install the .MVB files by executing SetupSDK.exe. These files can be
installed separately or together with the ActiveX SDK. (A copy of the
SDK is in the ACTX_SDK folder on this companion CD.) If you choose the 
same options as when you install the SDK, the .MVB files will be 
installed right into the SDK.

After installing the documentation, you can open it by selecting the
ActiveX SDK Help Infoviewer in the Start menu.
