The program Setup.exe will copy the first two folders -- the chapter
code and the Tangram program -- onto your hard disk.  You will need
about 7.6 MB of space on your hard disk for this code.  You can, of
course, simply use these materials from the CD if you prefer.

If you have copied the code files to your hard disk using Setup.exe,
you can uninstall them using the "Add/Remove Programs" feature on your
Control Panel.

Several of the other folders contain setup programs to install their
materials on your hard disk.  Use them at your option.  Each such
folder contains a README.TXT file with installation details.

Enjoy!
