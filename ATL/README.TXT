ActiveX Template Library
------- -------- -------

A newer version of the ActiveX Template Library may be available.  For
details, check this Web site:

The ActiveX(TM) Template Library (ATL) was created to provide
developers with a convenient mechanism for building lightweight and
fast COM (Component Object Model) objects. COM is the technical
underpinning of all Microsoft ActiveX technologies.

Templates are a code reuse feature of the C++ language that allow
developers to define a specific software implementation without yet
knowing the type of data that will flow through it. In the ActiveX
Templates, Microsoft has defined the specific software implementation
for generating the smallest COM objects. Developers will define the
types of data that are specific to their application. By exploiting
the power of C++, the ATL templates provide a standard way of writing
code for every combination of COM interface and data type in an ActiveX
component.

The files on this CD contain the complete template source code,
reference documentation, a white paper describing the technology, a
technical note, several samples, and a Wizard that can be used with the
Visual C++ 4.x development environment for generating applications
using the new templates. 

The WIN95 folder contains self-extracting executable files for use
with Windows 95 and Windows NT 4.0.  The NT351 folder contains
compressed versions of these files for use with Windows NT 3.51,
as well as the file README.TXT, which explains how to install the files
using PKUNZIP.  Here is a brief summary of what is in each file.
