
WinVerifyTrust distinguishes between a "test" root and a "real" root in the trust hierarchy.
The makecert.exe utility allows you to create test certificates. These test certificates can be used
only for trial runs. You must apply for bona fide credentials from agencies such as VeriSign and GTE. 
These credentials are inserted in the real hierarchy. 

The default behavior of Internet Explorer 3.0 is to treat code signed under the test root as invalid. 
This means it is considered to be unsigned and the appropriate warning message is displayed. 
However, the Internet Explorer SDK contains a file called wvtston.reg. (There is a pointer to this file
in the SDK's Readme file.) Once this file is installed, code signed under the test root is treated as
including credentials, but credentials that are void. The bitmap dialog is displayed, but with the
word VOID splashed across it. These credentials can be stored in the local trust database.
To return to the default behavior, use the file called wvtstoff.reg.
