README file for the License Package Authoring Tool - LPK_TOOL.EXE
=================================================================

Description
===========

The License Package Authoring Tool (LPK) allows you to author an 
LPK file.

An HTML Page with licensed controls requires a single associated 
license package which stores the run-time licenses for all the 
controls used on the page. The HTML page should point to a license 
package via a relative URL. This tool allows you to author a 
license package file.

For more information on Licensing, please refer to the following 
document.

Title: Online Licensing of ActiveX controls.
