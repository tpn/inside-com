To build the FrameWrk first run setenv.bat to be sure the ActiveX SDK
include, bin, and lib directories are included first in your environment.
Then run the 'nmake' to build a debug build, or 'nmake nodebug=1' to build a
nodebug (retail) build of the framework library.

After building the FrameWrk libraries you can build the other BaseCtl samples.
