Some files that you need to compile and run the example program for
this chapter are fairly new and may not have come with your compiler.
You can find copies of these files in the \Comp_Cat folder on the
companion CD.

To compile the example program, make sure these files are installed:
  COMCAT.H       in your standard directory for header files,
                 where (for example) OBJBASE.H is located
  UUID3.LIB      in your standard directory for statically linked
                 library files, where for example UUID.LIB is located.

To run the example program, make sure you have COMCAT.DLL, the
  Component Category Manager, installed on your system.  If you don't
  have it already, run the program CCDIST.EXE from the companion CD.
  (On Windows NT 3.51, run the program CCDIST35.EXE instead.)  This
  program will install the Component Category Manager for you.
  Reboot to complete the installation.
